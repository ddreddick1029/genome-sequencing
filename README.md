# genome-sequencing
This repository shows the reading of a specified file and calculating the percentage of nucleotides in a genome sequence of Escherichia coli and Thermophiles

We will utilize Python to:

- :white_check_mark: count the number of the nucleotides throughout the files
- :white_check_mark: count the number of each nucleotide line by line (did not complete, would construct code but would only print 10k lines)
- :negative_squared_cross_mark: find the percentage of appearances of each nucleotide
- :white_check_mark: construct a bar chart to illustrate the results

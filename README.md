# genome-sequencing
This repository shows the reading of a specified file and calculating the percentage of nucleotides in a genome sequence of Escherichia coli and Thermophiles

We will utilize Python to:

*count the number of the nucleotides throughout the files
*count the number of each nucleotide line by line
*find the percentage of appearances of each nucleotide
*construct a bar chart to illustrate the results
